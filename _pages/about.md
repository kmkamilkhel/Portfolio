I am a remote sensing and machine learning researcher with a focus on vegetation dynamics, wildfire disturbance, and forest ecosystem monitoring. My work combines optical and microwave satellite observations with statistical and machine-learning methods to support evidence-based forest management and climate adaptation.

### Current positions

- **Lecturer / Researcher**, Institute of Forest Sciences, University of Swat, Pakistan  
- **PhD candidate**, College of Forestry, Beijing Forestry University, China  

### Research interests

- Vegetation remote sensing (Landsat, Sentinel-1/2, MODIS, GEDI)
- Burn severity and post-fire vegetation recovery
- Spatio-temporal vegetation dynamics and climate variability
- Machine learning for ecological monitoring (Random Forest, deep learning, SHAP, etc.)
- Forest disturbance, fragmentation, and carbon dynamics

### Selected ongoing work

- Long-term vegetation trend analysis across Pakistan using satellite-derived indices.
- Fire severity and vegetation recovery assessment using Sentinel-2 and machine-learning models.
- Climate–growth relationships and scenario-based projections using tree-ring chronologies.

Outside research, I enjoy mentoring students in remote sensing, R, and Python, and developing reproducible geospatial workflows that can be shared with the wider community.
